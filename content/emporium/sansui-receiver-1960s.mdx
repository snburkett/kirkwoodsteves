This beautiful little setup is currently in my living room and looks and sounds great.  The receiver, speakers and turntable came from a single estate sale, and were clean and well kept.

The receiver did have a couple of bulbs out and some snap, crackle and pop when adjusting the volume when I first picked it up, but new bulbs and a thorough cleaning and lubrication were all it took to get everything looking and sounding great.

I love the vintage sound, people say it's "tube-like" which makes sense, this was a very early solid state receiver and was likely tuned to match the tube amps it superceded.  I personally like to click the Sansui speakers over to their "clean" setting for a slightly more modern sound.  

The cartridge on this German made Dual 1019 is kind of funky.  It's suspended by springs so the tonearm basically floats above the stylus.  My understanding is that it was advertised as being super safe for your vinyl.  Replacement parts are readily available, and if you don't love it you can swap to a more traditional rigid setup with a new sled.

We've got a little bluetooth receiver on the aux in and Sheila and I are really enjoying listening to albums, broadcast radio, and spotify.  We'll definitely miss this one when it goes!
