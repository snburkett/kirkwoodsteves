Everything you see... Early 1980's 2600 4-switch console with all the original gear â€” instruction manual, paddles and joysticks, "Combat" game and VHS switchbox. *AND* a beautiful Magnavox 13" color TV (model 13PR12) complete with remote and coax adapter. Space Invaders (shown) included as a bonus!

The "Model 2600A" box is in good condition and is correct for this console, though the serial numbers don't match. This console and accessories came from a large estate sale lot of used and abused Atari gear, from which I selected the best pieces.

This was the cleanest console in the collection and I thoroughly tested and repaired as necessary to ensure that *everything* works as it should. Controllers show some light wear and tear but work perfectly. The TV is in fantastic condition with all documentation. It's RF-only input perfect for the 2600 or your vintage VHS.

I've got loads of other fully tested, working cartridges on hand am ready to make a package deal!
