🌀 **Options wheel vs. chill buy & hold**  
I keep bumping into takes that one will always crush the other. Rather than rely on hot takes, here's a sandbox that models a stock with adjustable drift/volatility/beta and then lets a wheel strategy chew through it with tunable option cadences, OTM targets, and premium assumptions.
