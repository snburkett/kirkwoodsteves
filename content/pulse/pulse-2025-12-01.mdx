- **Lion Health Fails To Meet City’s Definition Of A Hospital** (Webster-Kirkwood Times – News) — issue: Lion Health System's appeal to be recognized as a hospital was dismissed by the Des Peres Board of Adjustment.
details: Lion Health sought to convert the former St. Luke’s Hospital site into a for-profit wellness facility focused on substance abuse treatment. The city zoning officer determined the facility did not meet the city's definition of a hospital, making it ineligible for a conditional use permit transfer. Lion Health lacked property ownership, which the city argued meant it had no standing to appeal. The board dismissed the appeal citing lack of standing and precedent requiring ownership for permit transfer applications.
city_response: City staff recommended a more thorough review due to the facility's unique clinical focus, as current ordinances restrict the site to a general-purpose hospital with emergency room services. The city emphasized that changes in use require planning and zoning commission involvement.
next_steps: Lion Health was advised to purchase the property before reapplying for a permit transfer and to expect a more detailed review process.

- **Calls Proposed Webster Sales Tax Hike “Ludicrous”** (Webster-Kirkwood Times – News) — James Cunningham from Webster Groves criticizes the proposed sales tax increase from 1.5% to 2.25%, calling the 55% hike 'ludicrous.'
