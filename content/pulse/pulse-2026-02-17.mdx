## Kirkwood Pulse • February 17, 2026

issue: Kirkwood is facing a tear-down crisis where small starter homes are being replaced by larger, more expensive homes due to high land costs.
key_points:
  -: Land cost is the major factor in housing prices, often accounting for 65% to 100% of property value.
  -: Mandating homes to stay small and affordable is insufficient without addressing land affordability.
  -: Two ways to reduce land costs: increase supply or reduce demand; reducing demand is undesirable as high demand supports home value appreciation.
  -: Increasing supply can be done by building multi-story, multifamily buildings to share land costs among multiple families.
  -: Small apartment/condo buildings and townhomes offer partial solutions but don't fully meet the traditional starter home ideal.
  -: The ideal starter home is a detached, single-family home with a backyard, owned by the family living in it.
  -: Another approach is subdividing land into smaller lots to lower individual lot prices, making homeownership more attainable.
  -: Kirkwood’s zoning laws impose minimum lot sizes (7,500 sqft to 1 acre), limiting the ability to split lots and build multiple smaller homes.
  -: Example: A 10,100 sqft lot could not be split into two 7,500 sqft lots, forcing owners to sell to developers building larger homes.
  -: Current zoning restrictions hinder the creation of affordable starter homes by preventing lot subdivision.
implications: To revive starter homes in Kirkwood, zoning reforms allowing smaller lot sizes or alternative housing types are needed to make land more affordable and accessible to young families. event: Kirkwood City Council unanimously voted down a contract with Fybr for a parking technology solution.

  provider: Fybr
  description: Sensors under parking spaces provide real-time occupancy data to a mobile app and assist parking enforcement.
  features:
  -: 275 sensors installed initially at no cost
  -: Real-time parking availability via Park Kirkwood app
  -: Alerts for parking limit violations to Kirkwood Police Department
issues:
  -: City staff misrepresented the original contract history, incorrectly stating 69 spots at a cost of $14,973 instead of 275 spots at no cost.
  -: This error led to confusion and compounded misunderstandings during contract renewal discussions.
  -: Original contract expired on 2021-12-02; ownership and maintenance responsibility transferred to the city.
  -: City did not respond to Fybr's inquiries about sensor removal until 2025.
  -: System degradation occurred due to offline gateways and power issues, reducing sensor battery life.
  -: Only 69 sensors had sufficient battery life for reactivation, leading to a proposed relocation fee of $14,973.
consequences: Council rejected the new contract without clear understanding or alternative solutions, leaving Downtown Kirkwood without the proposed parking technology.
