## Kirkwood Pulse • January 18, 2026

issue: Kirkwood City Council approved a 14.8% electricity rate increase and raised the fixed customer charge from $8 to $10 due to rising costs and financial challenges.
background:
  rate_increase_date: October 17, 2025
  bill_increase_example:
  usage_kWh: 850
  bill_2021: 97
  bill_2026: 142
causes:
  -: Significant capital upgrades to Kirkwood’s electric grid and distribution infrastructure over the past decade, resulting in short-term debt.
  -: Increased overall electricity costs driven by rising demand from electric vehicles, heat pumps, and data centers.
  -: A newly discovered $13.8 million cash reserve deficit in Kirkwood Electric.
actions_taken:
  -: Hiring Utility Financial Solutions (UFS) to evaluate the electric department’s financial status and recommend solutions.
  -: Conducting a thorough audit of electric department expenditures over the last two fiscal years with results expected soon.
  -: Forced early retirement of Kirkwood Electric Director Mark Petty amid the financial concerns.
financial_details:
  capital_improvements_cost_5_years: 48780000
  bond_revenue_5_years: 34650000
  cash_reserve_drawdown: 14000000
  debt_financing_ratio: 71%
analysis: The $13.8 million deficit is largely due to infrastructure investments financed by bonds and cash reserves, reflecting a common municipal utility practice. The main financial pressures come from the cost of electricity purchased and sold, not solely the reserve deficit.
additional_notes: Transfers from the Kirkwood Electric Fund to the city’s General and Streets Capital Improvements funds have raised questions but are typical for municipal utilities.
