## Kirkwood Pulse • February 08, 2026

issue: Kirkwood City Council approved a 14.8% electricity rate increase and raised the fixed customer charge from $8 to $10 due to rising costs and financial challenges.
background:
  rate_increase_reasoning:
  -: Significant capital upgrades to the city’s electric grid and distribution infrastructure over the past decade, leading to short-term debt.
  -: Increased overall electricity costs driven by higher demand from electric vehicles, heat pumps, and data centers.
  -: A recently discovered $13.8 million cash reserve deficit in Kirkwood Electric.
  historical_costs:
  2021_bill_for_850_kWh: 97
  2026_bill_for_850_kWh: 142
actions_taken:
  -: Hiring Utility Financial Solutions (UFS) to evaluate the electric department’s financial position and recommend solutions.
  -: Conducting a thorough audit of electric department expenditures over the last two fiscal years with results expected soon.
  -: Forced early retirement of Kirkwood Electric Director Mark Petty amid the financial issues.
findings:
  financial_losses: Kirkwood Electric lost money in 4 of the last 5 years.
  capital_spending:
  total_spent_last_5_years: 48780000
  bond_financing: 34650000
  cash_reserve_drawdown: 14000000
  debt_financing_percentage: 71
  cash_reserve_deficit_cause: Primarily due to infrastructure upgrades and rising electricity costs, not an independent cause.
  overall_cash_flow: The $13.8 million drawdown is a small part of the overall financial situation.
context: Kirkwood Electric’s situation mirrors many municipal utilities nationwide undergoing infrastructure upgrades financed by bonds and cash reserves to improve long-term reliability and efficiency.
additional_notes:
  transfers: Transfers from the electric fund to the city’s General and Streets Capital Improvements funds have raised questions but are typical for municipal utilities.
