## Kirkwood Pulse • February 18, 2026

project_overview:
  developer: Double Eagle Development
  location: Former Public Works site, Kirkwood
  proposal: 202 homes in six four-story buildings with 247 parking spots
  features:
  -: Pedestrian-friendly streets and sidewalks
  -: Gathering spaces and art installations
  -: Robust trees and plantings
  -: Ranch and townhome layouts with covered front porches
  -: Private attached garages
  -: State-of-the-art amenities including pool, fitness center, lounge, grill stations
  -: Architectural elements reflecting historic Kirkwood homes with modern features
  -: New through street connecting Taylor to Fillmore
  zoning: New R-7 Planned Multifamily zoning code proposed for project approval
community_reactions:
  positive:
  -: New through street improves connectivity and walkability
  negative:
  -: No hotel included despite original RFP requirement
  -: No ground-floor retail allowed, limiting neighborhood business opportunities
  -: Six blocky, similar buildings lacking human scale
  -: Extensive surface parking reminiscent of suburban developments
  -: Missed opportunity for structured parking and community spaces like a town square
uncertainties:
  -: Final design details still pending
  -: Financial terms for city not yet disclosed
  -: Potential changes during approval process
additional_context: The project aims to offset the $12 million city expenditure for the new public works site. The Grant’s Trail extension nearby could increase foot traffic, but lack of retail is seen as a lost economic opportunity. context: The article discusses the proposals submitted for the Public Works site redevelopment in Kirkwood, focusing on the bids rejected by the City Council after a two-stage RFP process.
key_points:
  -: Five initial applicants submitted bids: Double Eagle, Keeley, Ridgehouse, Savoy, and Mehlman.
  -: The City Council provided feedback emphasizing preferences such as including a hotel, majority owner-occupied residential units, flexible height and density with contextual design, inclusion of KPAC surface parking lot, incentives excluding TIF, structured parking, and traditional architectural design.
  -: Keeley Properties proposed 233 homes in phases, including townhomes, multifamily units, a parking garage, and optional boutique hotel or mixed-use building, with strong integration into Kirkwood’s street grid and public parks.
  -: Ridgehouse Development proposed 30 townhomes, two 100-apartment buildings, retail space, and a large parking garage but did not include a through-street as requested.
  -: Savoy Properties offered the most retail-heavy plan with a 100-room hotel, 62 homes, mixed-use buildings with commercial space, and a water feature integrated with the creek for storm runoff retention.
  -: Mehlman Homes Reality proposed a 126-room hotel with retail and villas but apparently did not submit a revised proposal.
  -: Despite multiple hotel-including proposals, the Council rejected all, partly due to concerns that hotel requirements lowered the purchase price offered to the city.
  -: The article highlights a paradox between the Council’s stated desire to attract a hotel downtown and their rejection of hotel proposals.
additional_resources: Full submissions obtained via FOIA are available on Google Drive (link in original article). Keeley’s detailed responses to Council feedback provide insight into the decision-making process.
