## Kirkwood Pulse • October 30, 2025

Kirkwood is finalizing its application for a $6.8 million federal Safer Streets for All (SS4A) grant aimed at improving traffic calming, sidewalk infill, and pedestrian upgrades citywide. However, concerns have been raised that the grant application disproportionately focuses on a single area, potentially neglecting broader citywide safety improvements. grant:

- **Tired of the Speeders? Turn on the Cameras.** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — context: Kirkwood has invested heavily in making the city more walkable, including curb bump-outs, bike lanes, and other pedestrian safety measures.
speed_study:
  date: May 2024
  locations_studied: 75
  key_metric: 85th percentile speed
  findings:
  exceeding_threshold: 55
  threshold_definition: 85th percentile speed more than 5 mph over the limit
  recommended_actions:
  -: lower the speed limit
  -: redesign the street to slow drivers
  -: increase enforcement
  recommended_interventions:
  -:
  treatment: Speed Feedback Sign
  speed_reduction_mph: 3
  crash_reduction_percent: 70
  -:
  treatment: Roundabouts
  speed_reduction_mph: 6
  crash_reduction_percent: 75
  -:
  treatment: Raised Intersections
  speed_reduction_mph: 5
  crash_reduction_percent: 40
  -:
  treatment: Horizontal Deflection (e.g., curb extensions)
  speed_reduction_mph: 3
  crash_reduction_percent: 30
  -:
  treatment: Lower Speed Limits
  speed_reduction_mph: 4
  crash_reduction_percent: 25
  -:
  treatment: Speed Humps/Tables
  speed_reduction_mph: 10-20 at placed countermeasure
  crash_reduction_percent: 40
ongoing_and_planned_projects:
  -: Raised intersections at Clay & Argonne and Clay & Jefferson
  -: Lane reductions in Kirkwood Road project Phase I and II
  -: Mid-block crossing between The James and Global Foods
  -: Curb bump-outs on Lindeman, South Geyer Big Bend, and West Essex
  -: Sidewalk infill on East Essex between Dickson and Hill Drive (in partnership with Glendale)
  -: Purchase of eleven speed feedback cameras costing $59,815
  -: Speed limit reductions on West Monroe (25 to 20 mph) and West Jefferson (20 to 15 mph)
analysis:
  effectiveness: Interventions expected to reduce 85th percentile speeds by 3-6 mph and improve pedestrian safety significantly.
  limitations: Concerns remain about extreme speeders (99th percentile) who drive dangerously fast, with some recorded speeds possibly due to errors.
  criticisms:
  -: Lane reductions should extend further south on Kirkwood Road.
  -: Frustration over removal of sidewalks to avoid stop signs and opposition to some speed limit reductions. Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text. Sentiment: neutral (0) Priority: medium [Read more](https://kirkwoodgadfly.com/tired-of-the-speeders-turn-on-the-cameras/)
- **Kirkwood minimum lot size** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — The article discusses Kirkwood's tear-down crisis, attributing it to the high cost of land. It highlights that after spending around $500,000 to buy a lot, the additional $200,000 cost to tear down an existing small home and build a larger one seems relatively minor. The piece suggests that this trend is driven by expensive land prices rather than just housing demand. Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text. Sentiment: neutral (0) Priority: medium [Read more](https://kirkwoodgadfly.com/tag/kirkwood-minimum-lot-size/)
- **How To Revive the Starter Home** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — The article discusses Kirkwood's housing challenge where expensive land drives the demolition of small starter homes in favor of larger, costly replacements. It argues that simply mandating smaller, affordable homes won't preserve starter homes unless land costs are addressed. Two main strategies to reduce land costs are increasing supply or reducing demand, with the article favoring supply increase through multi-family buildings or townhomes. However, many residents prefer detached single-family homes with yards, which complicates solutions. Another proposed solution is subdividing land into smaller parcels to lower individual lot prices, making homeownership more accessible. Yet, Kirkwood's zoning laws impose minimum lot sizes (ranging from 7,500 sqft to 1 acre), preventing lot splits and encouraging large home builds. An example at 511 W Rose Hill Ave illustrates how zoning restrictions forced a teardown and large home build instead of subdividing the lot for multiple modest homes. The article implies that zoning reform is needed to revive affordable starter homes in Kirkwood. Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text.

- **String of Errors Leads to Rejection of Parking Solution** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — event: Kirkwood City Council unanimously voted down a contract with Fybr for a parking technology solution on September 4, 2025.
technology:
  provider: Fybr
  description: Sensors placed under parking spaces to provide real-time occupancy data, accessible via the Park Kirkwood app and used for parking enforcement.
  benefits:
  -: Real-time parking availability for visitors
  -: Automated alerts for parking limit violations
  -: Reduced labor-intensive enforcement
background:
  original_contract:
  period: December 3, 2020 to December 2, 2021
  scope: 275 parking sensors installed at no cost to Kirkwood
  purpose: Proof of concept for Fybr
  miscommunication:
  error: City staff incorrectly reported the original contract as covering 69 spots at a cost of $14,973 instead of 275 spots at no cost.
  impact: This mistake led to confusion and misunderstandings in the council's decision-making process.
contract_lapse_and_issues:
  contract_expiration: December 2, 2021
  maintenance: Responsibility transferred to city after contract expiration
  system_problems: Gateways went offline due to power issues, causing sensor battery drain and reduced functionality.
  reactivation_request: City requested reactivation in January 2025
  sensor_relocation:
  quantity: 69
  fee: 14973
  purpose: Replace dead sensors on Argonne Street until a new contract could be agreed upon
conclusion: The council rejected the new contract proposal amid confusion and lack of clear alternatives, despite the technology's potential benefits. Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text. Sentiment: neutral (0) Priority: medium [Read more](https://kirkwoodgadfly.com/string-of-errors-leads-to-rejection-of-parking-solution/)

  -: development named after Pitman School
process:
  status: Developer withdrew proposal before Council vote to restart approval process
  next_steps:
  -: Planning & Zoning hearing on October 15th
  -: Likely public hearing for zoning text change
  -: Return to City Council for final approval
  zoning_change:
  description: Allow residential use on first floor, currently banned
  informal_agreement: Council agreed to zoning code change in exchange for developer restarting process
  impact: Enables preferred design and more family-suitable larger apartments
community_feedback:
  initial_reaction: Negative feedback on original flat, bulky design
  council_preference: Preferred Concept P design aesthetically
  author_opinion: Supports removing strict ground-floor retail mandate to allow more and larger homes
zoning_context:
  current_code: Requires mixed-use with commercial on ground floor in Downtown Kirkwood main streets
  author_analysis: Strict retail mandate can be counterproductive; developers naturally include retail where viable
  parking_and_foot_traffic: Retail often requires more parking and may not be viable where foot traffic is low Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text. Sentiment: neutral (0) Priority: medium [Read more](https://kirkwoodgadfly.com/300-n-kirkwood-two-new-looks-one-big-vote/)
