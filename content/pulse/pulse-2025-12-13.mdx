speed_study:
  date: May 2024
  locations_studied: 75
  key_metric: 85th percentile speed
  findings:
  exceeding_threshold: 55
  threshold_definition: 85th percentile speed more than 5 mph over the limit indicates need for intervention
  recommendations:
  -: lower speed limits
  -: redesign streets to slow traffic
  -: increase enforcement

  from_mph: 25
  to_mph: 20
  -:
  location: West Jefferson between Clay and Kirkwood
  from_mph: 20
  to_mph: 15
analysis:
  effectiveness: Interventions expected to reduce 85th percentile speeds by 3-6 mph and improve pedestrian safety significantly.
  concerns: Extreme speeders (99th percentile) driving at dangerously high speeds remain a challenge; some recorded top speeds may be errors or emergency vehicles.
  author_opinion: Supports current efforts but desires more extensive lane reductions and better enforcement; critical of sidewalk removals and opposition to some speed limit reductions. The article discusses Kirkwood's tear-down crisis, attributing it to the high cost of land. It highlights that after spending around $500,000 to purchase a lot, the additional $200,000 cost to tear down an existing small home and build a larger one is relatively minor. The piece suggests that this economic dynamic is a key factor in the trend of replacing starter homes with bigger ones.

- **How To Revive the Starter Home** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — The article discusses Kirkwood's housing affordability challenges, focusing on the high cost of land as the main barrier to preserving starter homes for young families. It argues that mandating smaller, affordable homes alone won't solve the problem because land prices dominate property costs. To make land more affordable, the article suggests increasing supply either by building multi-family or multi-story buildings to share land costs or by subdividing land into smaller lots. However, Kirkwood's zoning laws, which enforce minimum lot sizes ranging from 7,500 sqft to one acre, prevent lot splitting, limiting the ability to create more affordable starter homes. An example is given where a 10,100 sqft lot could not be split to build two smaller homes, forcing redevelopment into a larger, more expensive home. The article implies that revising zoning regulations could help revive the starter home market in Kirkwood. Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text.

- **String of Errors Leads to Rejection of Parking Solution** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — event: Kirkwood City Council unanimously voted down a contract with Fybr for a parking technology solution on September 4, 2025.
technology:
  provider: Fybr
  description: Sensors placed under parking spaces provide real-time occupancy data to a mobile app and assist police with parking enforcement.
  previous_use: Installed 275 sensors from Dec 2020 to Dec 2021 at no cost as a proof of concept.
issues:
  -: City staff incorrectly reported the original contract as covering 69 spots at a cost of $14,973 instead of 275 spots at no cost.
  -: This misinformation led to confusion and misunderstandings during the contract renewal process.
  -: After the original contract expired in Dec 2021, ownership and maintenance responsibility transferred to the city.
  -: Communication failures and power issues caused many sensors to lose battery life and functionality.
  -: Fybr identified 69 sensors with sufficient battery life and offered to relocate them for $14,973, which was mistaken as the original contract cost.
consequences: Council rejected the new contract without a clear understanding of the facts or alternative solutions, leaving Downtown Kirkwood's parking issues unresolved.
stakeholders:
  -: Kirkwood City Council
  -: Fybr (technology provider)
  -: Kirkwood Electric (city staff)
  -: Kirkwood Police Department Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text. Sentiment: neutral (0) Priority: medium [Read more](https://kirkwoodgadfly.com/string-of-errors-leads-to-rejection-of-parking-solution/)
