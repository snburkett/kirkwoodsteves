      "ai_summary": "The article discusses Kirkwood's housing affordability challenges, focusing on the high cost of land as the main barrier to preserving starter homes for young families. It argues that mandating smaller, affordable homes alone won't solve the problem because land prices dominate property costs. To make land more affordable, the article suggests increasing supply either by building multi-family or multi-story buildings to share land costs or by subdividing land into smaller lots. However, Kirkwood's zoning laws, which enforce minimum lot sizes ranging from 7,500 sqft to one acre, prevent lot splitting, limiting the ability to create more affordable starter homes. An example is given where a 10,100 sqft lot could not be split to build two smaller homes, forcing redevelopment into a larger, more expensive home. The article implies that revising zoning regulations could help revive the starter home market in Kirkwood.",
