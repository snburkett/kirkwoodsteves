It highlights that after spending around $500,000 to purchase a lot, the additional $200,000 cost to tear down an existing small home and build a larger one is relatively minor. The piece suggests that the issue is tied to land prices rather than just housing policies. The article discusses Kirkwood's housing affordability crisis, focusing on the high cost of land as the primary barrier to preserving starter homes for young families. It argues that simply mandating smaller, affordable homes is insufficient because land prices dominate property costs. The author suggests two main strategies to reduce land costs: increasing supply by building multi-family or multi-story buildings, and breaking land into smaller parcels to lower individual lot prices. However, Kirkwood's zoning laws, which enforce minimum lot sizes ranging from 7,500 sqft to one acre, prevent lot splitting and thus limit the creation of affordable starter homes. An example is given where a 10,100 sqft lot could not be subdivided to build two modest homes, forcing owners to sell to buyers planning larger, more expensive homes. The article implies that zoning reform is necessary to revive the starter home market in Kirkwood.",
