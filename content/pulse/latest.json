It highlights that after spending around $500,000 to buy a lot, the additional $200,000 to demolish an existing small home and build a larger one is considered a minor expense, contributing to the trend of replacing starter homes with bigger houses. issue: Kirkwood is facing a tear-down crisis where small starter homes are being replaced by larger, more expensive homes due to high land costs.\nkey_points:\n  -: Land cost accounts for 65% to 100% of property value, making it difficult to maintain affordable starter homes.\n  -: Mandating small, affordable homes alone won't solve the problem; land affordability must be addressed.\n  -: Two ways to reduce land cost: increase supply or reduce demand.

And while I have nits to pick here and there, overall these efforts have been worthwhile and successful.
