  "overview": "issue: Kirkwood is facing a tear-down crisis where small starter homes are being replaced by larger, more expensive homes due to high land costs.\nkey_points:\n  -: Land cost is the major factor in housing prices, often accounting for 65% to 100% of property value.\n  -: Mandating homes to stay small and affordable is insufficient without addressing land affordability.\n  -: Two ways to reduce land costs: increase supply or reduce demand; reducing demand is undesirable as high demand supports home value appreciation.\n  -: Increasing supply can be done by building multi-story, multifamily buildings to share land costs among multiple families.\n  -: Small apartment/condo buildings and townhomes offer partial solutions but don't fully meet the traditional starter home ideal.\n  -: The ideal starter home is a detached, single-family home with a backyard, owned by the family living in it.\n  -: Another approach is subdividing land into smaller lots to lower individual lot prices, making homeownership more attainable.\n  -: Kirkwood’s zoning laws impose minimum lot sizes (7,500 sqft to 1 acre), limiting the ability to split lots and build multiple smaller homes.\n  -: Example: A 10,100 sqft lot could not be split into two 7,500 sqft lots, forcing owners to sell to developers building larger homes.\n  -: Current zoning restrictions hinder the creation of affordable starter homes by preventing lot subdivision.\nimplications: To revive starter homes in Kirkwood, zoning reforms allowing smaller lot sizes or alternative housing types are needed to make land more affordable and accessible to young families. event: Kirkwood City Council unanimously voted down a contract with Fybr for a parking technology solution.\ndate_of_vote: 2025-09-04\ntechnology:\n  provider: Fybr\n  description: Sensors under parking spaces provide real-time occupancy data to a mobile app and assist parking enforcement.\n  features:\n  -: 275 sensors installed initially at no cost\n  -: Real-time parking availability via Park Kirkwood app\n  -: Alerts for parking limit violations to Kirkwood Police Department\nissues:\n  -: City staff misrepresented the original contract history, incorrectly stating 69 spots at a cost of $14,973 instead of 275 spots at no cost.\n  -: This error led to confusion and compounded misunderstandings during contract renewal discussions.\n  -: Original contract expired on 2021-12-02; ownership and maintenance responsibility transferred to the city.\n  -: City did not respond to Fybr's inquiries about sensor removal until 2025.\n  -: System degradation occurred due to offline gateways and power issues, reducing sensor battery life.\n  -: Only 69 sensors had sufficient battery life for reactivation, leading to a proposed relocation fee of $14,973.\nconsequences: Council rejected the new contract without clear understanding or alternative solutions, leaving Downtown Kirkwood without the proposed parking technology.\nstakeholders:\n  -: Kirkwood City Council\n  -: Fybr (technology provider)\n  -: Kirkwood Police Department\n  -: City staff including Mark Petty and Russ Hawes project_name: Pitman Place\nlocation: 300 N.
