      "ai_summary": "The article discusses Kirkwood's housing challenge where expensive land drives the demolition of small starter homes in favor of larger, costly replacements. It argues that simply mandating smaller, affordable homes won't preserve starter homes unless land costs are addressed. Two main strategies to reduce land costs are increasing supply or reducing demand, with the article favoring supply increase through multi-family buildings or townhomes. However, many residents prefer detached single-family homes with yards, which complicates solutions. Another proposed solution is subdividing land into smaller parcels to lower individual lot prices, making homeownership more accessible. Yet, Kirkwood's zoning laws impose minimum lot sizes (ranging from 7,500 sqft to 1 acre), preventing lot splits and encouraging large home builds. An example at 511 W Rose Hill Ave illustrates how zoning restrictions forced a teardown and large home build instead of subdividing the lot for multiple modest homes. The article implies that zoning reform is needed to revive affordable starter homes in Kirkwood.",
