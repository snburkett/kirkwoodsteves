  "overview": "The article discusses Kirkwood's tear-down crisis, attributing it to the high cost of land. It highlights that after spending $500,000 on a lot, the additional $200,000 to demolish an existing small home and build a larger one is relatively minor, contributing to the trend of replacing starter homes with bigger ones. The article discusses Kirkwood's housing affordability crisis, focusing on the high cost of land as the main barrier to preserving starter homes for young families. It argues that simply mandating smaller, affordable homes won't solve the problem because land prices dominate property costs. The author suggests two ways to make land more affordable: increasing supply by building multi-family or multi-story buildings, and breaking land into smaller parcels to lower individual lot prices. However, Kirkwood's zoning laws, which enforce minimum lot sizes ranging from 7,500 sqft to one acre, prevent subdividing lots to create more affordable housing options. An example is given of a 10,100 sqft lot where splitting was impossible due to zoning, forcing owners to sell to developers who build larger homes. The article implies that revising zoning regulations to allow smaller lot sizes could help revive the availability of starter homes in Kirkwood. event: Kirkwood City Council unanimously voted down a contract with Fybr for a parking technology solution on September 4th.\ntechnology:\n  provider: Fybr\n  description: Sensors placed under parking spaces to provide real-time occupancy data, accessible via the Park Kirkwood app and used by police for enforcement.\n  benefits:\n  -: Real-time parking availability\n  -: Improved enforcement of parking limits\nissues:\n  -: City staff misrepresented the original Fybr contract details, incorrectly stating 69 spots at a cost of $14,973 instead of 275 spots at no cost.\n  -: This error led to confusion and misunderstandings during the contract renewal process.\n  -: Original contract expired December 2, 2021, with ownership and maintenance responsibility transferring to the city.\n  -: City did not respond to Fybr's inquiries about sensor removal until 2025, when reactivation was requested.\n  -: Many system gateways went offline due to power issues, causing sensor battery drain and reduced functionality.\n  -: Only 69 sensors had sufficient battery life for reactivation, leading to a relocation fee of $14,973.\nconsequences: Council rejected the new contract partly due to unclear information and lack of a clear alternative solution.\nauthor_opinion: The author expresses disappointment with the Council's decision and concern over the lack of understanding and alternatives.",
