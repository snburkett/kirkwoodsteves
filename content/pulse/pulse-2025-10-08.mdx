## Kirkwood Pulse • October 08, 2025

context: Kirkwood has invested heavily in making the city more walkable through infrastructure improvements like curb bump-outs, bike lanes, and lane reductions.
speed_study:
  date: May 2024
  locations: 75
  scope: City streets plus county and MoDOT roads
  key_metric: 85th percentile speed
  findings: In 55 of 75 locations, the 85th percentile speed exceeded the speed limit by more than 5 mph, indicating a need for intervention.
  recommended_actions:
  -: Lower speed limits
  -: Redesign streets to encourage slower driving
  -: Increase enforcement

  speed_reduction_mph: 10-20 at placed countermeasure
  crash_reduction_percent: 40
ongoing_and_planned_projects:
  -: Raised intersections at Clay & Argonne and Clay & Jefferson
  -: Lane reductions and mid-block crossing on Kirkwood Road Phase I and II
  -: Curb bump-outs on Lindeman, South Geyer Big Bend, and West Essex
  -: Sidewalk infill on East Essex (Glendale partnership)
  -: Purchase of eleven speed feedback cameras by City Council for $59,815
  -: Speed limit reductions on West Monroe (25 to 20 mph) and West Jefferson (20 to 15 mph)
analysis:
  effectiveness: Interventions expected to reduce 85th percentile speeds by 3-6 mph and improve pedestrian safety significantly.
  limitations: Concerns remain about extreme speeders (99th percentile) who drive much faster than typical speeds; some top recorded speeds may be measurement errors.
  criticisms:
  -: Desire for lane reductions to extend further south on Kirkwood Road
  -: Frustration with city staff removing sidewalks to avoid stop signs or opposing speed limit reductions The article discusses Kirkwood's tear-down crisis, attributing it to the high cost of land. It highlights that after spending around $500,000 to buy a lot, the additional $200,000 to demolish an existing small home and build a larger one is considered a minor expense, contributing to the trend of replacing starter homes with bigger houses. issue: Kirkwood is facing a tear-down crisis where small starter homes are being replaced by larger, more expensive homes due to high land costs.
key_points:
  -: Land cost accounts for 65% to 100% of property value, making it difficult to maintain affordable starter homes.
  -: Mandating small, affordable homes alone won't solve the problem; land affordability must be addressed.
  -: Two ways to reduce land cost: increase supply or reduce demand. Reducing demand is undesirable as high demand supports home value appreciation.
  -: Increasing supply can be done by building multi-family or multi-story buildings to share land costs among multiple families.
  -: Small condo/apartment buildings and townhomes help but don't fully meet the desire for detached single-family starter homes with backyards.
  -: Another solution is subdividing land into smaller lots to lower individual lot prices, making land more attainable for modest-income families.
  -: Kirkwood's zoning code limits lot subdivision due to minimum lot size requirements (7,500 sqft to 1 acre depending on zone), preventing splitting lots for multiple smaller homes.
  -: Example: A 10,100 sqft lot at 511 W Rose Hill Ave could not be split to build two homes due to the 7,500 sqft minimum, forcing owners to sell to developers building larger homes.
conclusion: To revive starter homes in Kirkwood, zoning reforms allowing smaller lot sizes and encouraging multi-family housing are necessary to make land more affordable and accessible to young families.

- **String of Errors Leads to Rejection of Parking Solution** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — event: Kirkwood City Council unanimously voted down a contract with Fybr for a parking technology solution on September 4, 2025.
technology:
  provider: Fybr
  description: Sensors placed under parking spaces to provide real-time occupancy data via the Park Kirkwood app and assist police with parking enforcement.
  previous_use: Installed 275 sensors from Dec 2020 to Dec 2021 at no cost as a proof of concept.
issues:
  -: City staff misrepresented the original contract history, incorrectly stating 69 spots at a cost of $14,973 instead of 275 spots at no cost.
  -: This error led to confusion and misunderstandings during the contract renewal process.
  -: After the original contract expired in Dec 2021, the city assumed ownership and maintenance but failed to maintain the system properly, causing hardware failures.
  -: Fybr identified only 69 sensors with sufficient battery life for reactivation and proposed relocating them for $14,973.
consequences: Council rejected the new contract without a clear understanding of the proposal or alternative solutions, leaving Downtown Kirkwood's parking issues unresolved.
stakeholders:
  -: Kirkwood City Council
  -: Fybr (technology provider)
  -: Kirkwood Police Department
  -: Kirkwood Electric (Mark Petty) Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text. Sentiment: neutral (0) Priority: medium [Read more](https://kirkwoodgadfly.com/string-of-errors-leads-to-rejection-of-parking-solution/)
- **Pitman Project Heads Back to P&Z** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — project:
  name: Pitman Project
  location: 300 N. Kirkwood Rd
  description: A 60-apartment development with retail space
  developer: Stock & Associates
  zoning: Fits within city’s zoning code
issue: Design concerns with original flat, bulky, uninspired renderings
design_options:
  -:
  option: 1
  features: Three-tiered gable roofs, alternating bands of stone and brick, horizontal visual emphasis, shorter and more human-scaled appearance
  -:
  option: 2
  features: Includes Option 1 features plus balconies and five direct-entrance apartments on Adams side, creating active street presence and townhome-style living
  drawbacks: Facade cohesion affected by white stone interrupting horizontal banding; fixable by replacing white stone with red brick
prospects:
  legal: Council has limited ability to block project due to zoning compliance
  decision: Council must choose between two improved design options
  considerations: Option 2 requires variances and active Council approval for code departures
  community_action: Residents encouraged to support the project by attending Council meeting or emailing City Clerk Laurie Asche Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text. Sentiment: neutral (0) Priority: medium [Read more](https://kirkwoodgadfly.com/300-n-kirkwood-two-new-looks-one-big-vote/)
