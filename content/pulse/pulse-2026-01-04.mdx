## Kirkwood Pulse • January 04, 2026

context: Kirkwood has invested significantly in making the community more walkable through infrastructure improvements like curb bump-outs and bike lanes, but speeding remains a major issue.
speed_study:
  date: May 2024
  locations_studied: 75
  key_metric: 85th percentile speed
  findings:
  exceeding_threshold: 55
  threshold_definition: 85th percentile drivers exceeding speed limit by more than 5 mph
  recommendations:
  -: lower speed limits
  -: redesign streets to slow traffic
  -: increase enforcement
  recommended_interventions:
  -:

  speed_reduction_mph: 3

  speed_reduction_mph: 4
  crash_reduction_percent: 25

  treatment: Speed Humps/Tables
  speed_reduction_mph: 10-20 at countermeasure
  crash_reduction_percent: 40
ongoing_and_planned_projects:
  -: Raised intersections at Clay & Argonne and Clay & Jefferson
  -: Lane reductions in Kirkwood Road Phase I and II projects
  -: Curb bump-outs on Lindeman, South Geyer Big Bend, and West Essex
  -: Sidewalk infill on East Essex between Dickson and Hill Drive (in partnership with Glendale)
  -: Purchase of eleven speed feedback cameras costing $59,815
  -: Speed limit reductions on West Monroe (25 to 20 mph) and West Jefferson (20 to 15 mph)
analysis:
  effectiveness: Interventions expected to reduce 85th percentile speeds by 3-6 mph and improve pedestrian safety
  concerns: High-end speeders (99th percentile) driving extremely fast remain a challenge; some recorded top speeds may be errors or emergency vehicles
  criticisms:
  -: Lane reductions should extend further south on Kirkwood Road
  -: Frustration with removal of sidewalks to avoid stop signs
  -: Opposition to some speed limit reductions The article discusses Kirkwood's tear-down crisis, attributing it to the high cost of land. It highlights that after spending around $500,000 to purchase a lot, the additional $200,000 cost to tear down an existing small home and build a larger one is relatively minor. The piece suggests that the issue is tied to land prices rather than just housing policies. The article discusses Kirkwood's housing affordability crisis, focusing on the high cost of land as the primary barrier to preserving starter homes for young families. It argues that simply mandating smaller, affordable homes is insufficient because land prices dominate property costs. The author suggests two main strategies to reduce land costs: increasing supply by building multi-family or multi-story buildings, and breaking land into smaller parcels to lower individual lot prices. However, Kirkwood's zoning laws, which enforce minimum lot sizes ranging from 7,500 sqft to one acre, prevent lot splitting and thus limit the creation of affordable starter homes. An example is given where a 10,100 sqft lot could not be subdivided to build two modest homes, forcing owners to sell to buyers planning larger, more expensive homes. The article implies that zoning reform is necessary to revive the starter home market in Kirkwood.

- **String of Errors Leads to Rejection of Parking Solution** (Kirkwood Gadfly) — event: Kirkwood City Council unanimously rejected a contract with Fybr for a parking technology solution on September 4th.
technology:
  provider: Fybr
  description: Sensors placed under parking spaces to provide real-time occupancy data, integrated with the Park Kirkwood app and enforcement alerts for parking limits.
  benefits:
  -: Real-time parking availability for visitors
  -: Automated alerts for parking limit violations
  -: Improved enforcement efficiency compared to manual monitoring
background:
  original_contract:
  period: December 3, 2020 to December 2, 2021
  scope: 275 parking sensors installed at no cost to Kirkwood
  purpose: Proof of concept and demonstration for Fybr
  miscommunication:
  error: City staff incorrectly reported the original contract as covering 69 spots at a cost of $14,973 instead of 275 spots at no cost.
  impact: This mistake led to misunderstandings and influenced the council's decision.
contract_lapse_and_issues:
  contract_expiry: December 2, 2021
  ownership_transfer: Hardware ownership and maintenance responsibility transferred to Kirkwood at no cost.
  maintenance_problems: Gateways went offline due to power issues, causing sensor battery drain and reduced functionality.
  reactivation_request: City requested reactivation in January 2025; Fybr identified only 69 sensors with sufficient battery life.
  replacement_fee: $14,973 charged to relocate and reactivate these 69 sensors.
conclusion: The council's rejection was influenced by inaccurate information and lack of a clear alternative, despite the technology's potential benefits. Impact: Impact unclear based on automatically extracted text. Sentiment: neutral (0) Priority: medium [Read more](https://kirkwoodgadfly.com/string-of-errors-leads-to-rejection-of-parking-solution/)
