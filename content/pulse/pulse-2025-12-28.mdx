## Kirkwood Pulse • December 28, 2025

issue: Kirkwood City Council approved a 14.8% electricity rate increase and raised the fixed customer charge from $8 to $10 due to rising costs and financial challenges.
background:
  rate_increase_date: October 17, 2025
  bill_comparison:
  July_2021: $97 for 850 kWh
  July_2026: $142 for 850 kWh
causes:
  -: Significant capital upgrades to Kirkwood’s electrical grid and distribution infrastructure over the past decade, resulting in short-term debt.
  -: Increased overall electricity costs driven by rising demand from electric vehicles, heat pumps, and data centers.
  -: A recently discovered $13.8 million cash reserve deficit in Kirkwood Electric.
actions_taken:
  -: Hiring of Utility Financial Solutions (UFS) to evaluate the electric department’s financial position and recommend corrective measures.
  -: Implementation of a recommended 14.8% rate increase to rebuild $13 million in reserves by 2031.
  -: Engagement of an accounting firm to audit electric department expenditures for the last two fiscal years, with results forthcoming.
  -: Early retirement of Kirkwood Electric Director Mark Petty amid council concerns.
financial_details:
  capital_improvements_cost: ~$48.78 million over five years
  bond_sales_revenue: ~$34.65 million
  cash_reserve_drawdown: ~$14 million to cover remaining costs
  debt_financing_ratio: Approximately 71%, typical for municipal utilities
analysis: The $13.8 million deficit is primarily a symptom of infrastructure investments and rising electricity costs rather than an independent cause. Kirkwood Electric’s financial health largely depends on electricity purchase and sale prices. Transfers from the electric fund to other city funds have raised questions but are typical for municipal utilities.
implications: The rate increase aims to stabilize Kirkwood Electric’s finances and ensure long-term reliability and efficiency of the electric grid amid growing demand and infrastructure needs.
