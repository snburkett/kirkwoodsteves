## Kirkwood Pulse • December 23, 2025

The article honors Doris 'Dorie' Callahan, a beloved St. Louis mother and community member who passed away five years ago. Known for her dedication to family, church, and community, Dorie raised five children with her husband George in Holly Hills. She was active in parish activities, served as an election judge, and worked over 30 years in the fine china department at Famous-Barr. The story was inspired by a brunch strata recipe she submitted to a local high school cookbook, which has been a family tradition for over 50 years. Through interviews with her family and friends, the article paints a portrait of a humble woman whose life positively impacted many, leaving a lasting legacy through her loved ones and cherished recipes. Kirkwood officials have installed a sculpture celebrating Route 66 at the corner of Kirkwood Road and Argonne. A local resident, Kathy M. Widman, expressed confusion about the sculpture's placement, noting that Kirkwood Road (Lindbergh) is associated with U.S. highways 61/67, while Watson Road (Missouri Route 366) is the former section of Route 66. She questions the logic behind the sculpture's location. James W. Whitney, former municipal judge of Webster Groves for over 26 years, responded to recent reports of dysfunction in the Webster Groves municipal court. He emphasized that long-serving court clerks Diane Reinhart and Terry Bales were professional and efficient, and that court issues arose only after their departure. Whitney attributed the court's recent problems to poor hiring practices and high employee turnover during his last three-plus years of service. He highlighted the importance of retaining competent, long-serving employees for the city's benefit.
