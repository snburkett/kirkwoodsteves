## Kirkwood Pulse • December 05, 2025

issue: Kirkwood City Council approved a 14.8% electricity rate increase and raised the fixed customer charge from $8 to $10 due to rising costs and financial challenges within Kirkwood Electric.
background:
  rate_increase_date: October 17, 2025
  historical_cost_increase: Typical household electric bill for 850 kWh rose from $97 in July 2021 to $142 projected in July 2026.
  main_causes:
  -: Significant capital upgrades to the electric grid and infrastructure over the past decade, leading to short-term debt.
  -: Increased overall electricity costs due to rising demand (electric vehicles, heat pumps, data centers).
  -: A newly discovered $13.8 million cash reserve deficit at Kirkwood Electric.
actions_taken:
  -: Hiring Utility Financial Solutions (UFS) to evaluate financial position and recommend solutions.
  -: Conducting a thorough audit of electric department expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
  -: Forced early retirement of Kirkwood Electric Director Mark Petty amid the financial concerns.
financial_details:
  capital_improvements_cost: ~$48.78 million over five years
  bond_financing: ~$34.65 million (71% of capital improvements)
  cash_reserve_drawdown: ~$14 million to cover remaining costs
  reserve_deficit: $13.8 million
  goal: Rebuild $13 million in reserves by 2031 through rate increases.
analysis: The cash reserve deficit is largely a symptom of infrastructure investments and rising electricity costs rather than an independent cause. Kirkwood Electric's financial health mainly depends on electricity purchase and sale prices. Transfers from the electric fund to city funds have raised questions but are typical for municipal utilities.
implications: The rate increase aims to stabilize Kirkwood Electric’s finances and ensure long-term reliability and efficiency of the electric grid amid growing demand and infrastructure needs.
