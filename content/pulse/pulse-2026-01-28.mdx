  -: Uncertainty about project appearance and financial details
additional_notes: City aims to offset $12 million cost of new public works site through this development. More details expected in future updates. context: The City Council of Kirkwood conducted a two-stage Request for Proposals (RFP) process for the Public Works site, receiving bids from five developers: Double Eagle, Keeley, Ridgehouse, Savoy, and Mehlman. The Council provided feedback emphasizing preferences for a hotel inclusion, majority owner-occupied residential units, flexible building height and density with traditional architectural design, inclusion of KPAC surface parking with maintained or increased public parking, no Tax Increment Financing (TIF), and structured parking.
key_points:
  -: Keeley Properties proposed 233 homes in two stages, including townhomes, multifamily units, a 477-stall parking garage shared with KPAC patrons, public pocket parks, and an optional boutique hotel or mixed-use building on the KPAC parking lot.
  -: Ridgehouse Development proposed 30 for-sale townhomes, two 100-apartment buildings, 9,000 sqft retail, and a 654-space parking garage behind KPAC but did not include a through-street as requested.
  -: Savoy Properties offered the most retail-heavy plan with a 100-room hotel on the KPAC lot, 62 homes (villas, townhomes, mixed-use), ~15,000 sqft commercial space, and a new water feature integrated with the adjacent creek for storm runoff retention.
  -: Mehlman Homes Reality proposed a 126-room hotel (Marriott A-Loft or similar), 15,000 sqft retail, 27 villas, and 148 parking spots but did not submit a revised proposal.
  -: All three hotel-including proposals were ultimately rejected by the Council, continuing a pattern of rejecting hotel projects despite city leadership's emphasis on attracting hotels downtown.
  -: Council feedback indicated that requiring a hotel lowered the developers' offers for the site, influencing the rejection decisions.
overall_outcome: Double Eagle was selected as the winning proposal, with other bids rejected following Council feedback and revisions.
